TriviaNow is a robust quiz management system.
In addition to playing a three-question game of trivia, you can add, edit, delete, and search for questions.
You can also save your question data to a file for later use or open an existing file to load into the program.
All of these functions can be accessed from the main menu.

The File menu located near the upper-left corner of the main menu has three options:
1. Open - Opens file explorer in the Debug folder of the program.
	  From here, you can open a .dat file containing question data or cancel the operation.
2. Save - Opens file explorer in the Debug folder of the program.
	  From here, you can create/save a new .dat file, overwrite an existing one, or cancel the operation.
3. Exit - Opens a message box asking you if you're sure you want to exit the program.
	  From here, you can save before exitting, exit without saving, or cancel the operation.

The Question menu located near the upper-left corner of the main menu has two options:
1. Add - Opens a form that allows you to add a new question.
2. Search - Opens a form that allows you to search through the list of questions.
	    At least one question must be in the program before you can use this feature.
	    To start searching, type something in the search bar and press enter.
            Matching results will be displayed in the form's list box.
	    To perform another search, simply change your search text and press enter again.

The Start Game button located near the bottom of the main menu allows you to start a game of trivia.
At least three questions must be in the program before you can use this feature.

The large list box located in the main menu displays every question that's in the program.

Pressing the delete or backspace key while a question is selected displays a message box.
At least one question must be in the program before you can use this feature.
The message box asks you if you want to delete the selected question.
From here, you can delete the question or cancel the operation.

Double-clicking on a question while it's selected opens a form that allows you to edit the question's data.
At least one question must be in the program before you can use this feature.

The AddQuestion, UpdateQuestion, SearchQuestions, and TriviaGame forms can all be exited using the x button located in the top-right corner of the window.
This will cancel the operation and take you back to the main menu.
